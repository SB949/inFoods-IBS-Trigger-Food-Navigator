      "ingredients": [
        "1 1/2 pounds (about 2) boneless, skinless chicken breast",
        "Kosher salt",
        "1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper",
        "5 tablespoons cornstarch",
        "6 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, divided",
        "4 cups (about 1 pound) broccoli florets",
        "1/2 tablespoon grated garlic (from about 3 cloves)",
        "1/2 teaspoon grated ginger",
        "1 1/2 cups chicken broth",
        "1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder, such as Lee Kum Kee brand",
        "1/2 teaspoon sugar",
        "Hot steamed rice, for serving"
      ],
      "instructions": "1. Cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise, then cut them again at a slight angle into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper and 3 tablespoons cold water. Use your hands (wear gloves if you like) to massage the seasonings into the chicken until most is absorbed, about 1 minute. Add 3 tablespoons cornstarch and mix until the cornstarch is moistened. Add 3 tablespoons neutral oil and massage until combined. Set the chicken aside to marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n2. Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a wok over high heat and add 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon neutral oil. Add the broccoli and boil until it turns bright green, about 2 minutes. Drain the broccoli and rinse under cold water until the broccoli is cool enough to handle. Drain and set aside.\n3. Stir the remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 3 tablespoons cold water together in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.\n4. Heat a wok over high heat until you see the first few wisps of smoke, about 3 minutes. Remove the wok from the heat and add the remaining 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and swirl to coat the wok. Return to high heat and add the marinated chicken. Spread it out evenly so every chicken piece has contact with the wok. Let sit until it starts to brown, about 2 minutes. Toss the chicken with a wok turner or spatula and cook until just slightly pink, about 2 minutes.\n5. Add the grated garlic and ginger to the wok and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the broccoli and stir-fry 30 seconds. Add the chicken broth, bouillon powder and sugar and bring to a boil. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.\n6. Slowly drizzle the cornstarch slurry into the wok and continue to cook until the sauce thickens and coats the broccoli. Pour the mixture over hot steamed rice and serve immediately.",

Add 1/2 cup water, the parsley, raisins, 1 tablespoon of the vinegar and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until most of the water is absorbed and the mixture gets saucy, about 1 minute. Let cool slightly.\n3. Meanwhile, toss the pepper halves with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave until the peppers are pliable, 10 to 12 minutes. Carefully uncover the bowl and pour out any liquid that has accumulated.\n4. Stir the couscous into the beef mixture. Whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1 tablespoon vinegar and 3/4 cup water in the bottom of a large baking dish.\n5. Carefully transfer the peppers to the baking dish cut-side up and fill each pepper with the couscous mixture. Sprinkle with the cheese. Cover with foil and bake until the peppers are tender and the stuffing is hot, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature drizzled with the tomato cooking liquid.",

Add the tomatoes and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook until the tomatoes are softened and beginning to burst, about 5 minutes. Add the white wine and 1/4 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme sprigs. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.\nFor the herb-ricotta dumplings: Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Put the ricotta in a medium bowl, add the flour, basil, chives, egg, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and gently combine until it just forms a sticky dough. Generously flour a work surface with semolina flour. Place the dough on the semolina and sprinkle the top with a light dusting of more semolina. Press out the dough into a rectangle about 8 inches by 6 inches and 1/2 inch thick. Cut into 1-inch squares.\nTransfer the dumplings to the boiling water with a slotted spoon and cook until tender and floating, about 5 minutes. Transfer the dumplings with the same spoon to the sauce; let sit for 2 minutes (resting will help the dumplings keep their shape). Gently toss with the sauce. Divide into bowls and top with grated Pecorino Romano and a drizzle of olive oil.",

        "1/4 cup (32 grams) confectioners' sugar",

      ],
      "instructions": "For the crust: Heat your oven to 350 degrees F and set out a 9-inch pie plate or 10-inch removable bottom tart pan. If using a tart pan, place on a baking sheet to avoid any butter leaks. Stir together the digestive biscuit or graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, salt and cinnamon in a bowl. Add in the butter and toss well to evenly combine. Transfer the crumb mixture to the pie plate or tart pan and, using the bottom of a measuring cup or glass, evenly press the crust along the bottom and up the sides. Bake the crust for 15 minutes, then set aside to cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, prepare the filling.\nFor the filling: Melt the butter and brown sugar together in a medium saucepan over medium to medium-low heat. Once melted, add in the sweetened condensed milk and bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown and the mixture starts to pull away from the sides of the pan, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the salt and 1 teaspoon of the vanilla. Set aside to cool slightly. When cooled slightly, transfer the toffee mixture into the crust and spread into an even layer. Scatter with the toffee bits and top with the sliced banana. Cover with plastic and transfer to the fridge for at least 2 hours to chill and firm up. When chilled, whip the cream, confectioners' sugar and remaining teaspoon of vanilla on medium speed until soft peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. By whipping the cream on medium, the bubble structure will be smaller giving the whipped cream more stability which will allow it to hold up for longer. Dollop and swirl the whipped cream on top of the bananas and garnish with the chocolate shavings. This pie can be kept in the fridge for up to 5 days. To keep the whipped cream tasting fresh, I like to store it under an upturned mixing bowl as a make-shift lid.",
