        "1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper",
        "5 tablespoons cornstarch",
        "6 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, divided",
        "4 cups (about 1 pound) broccoli florets",
        "1/2 tablespoon grated garlic (from about 3 cloves)",
        "1/2 teaspoon grated ginger",
        "1 1/2 cups chicken broth",
        "1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder, such as Lee Kum Kee brand",
        "1/2 teaspoon sugar",
        "Hot steamed rice, for serving"
      ],
      "instructions": "1. Cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise, then cut them again at a slight angle into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper and 3 tablespoons cold water. Use your hands (wear gloves if you like) to massage the seasonings into the chicken until most is absorbed, about 1 minute. Add 3 tablespoons cornstarch and mix until the cornstarch is moistened. Add 3 tablespoons neutral oil and massage until combined. Set the chicken aside to marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n2. Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a wok over high heat and add 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon neutral oil. Add the broccoli and boil until it turns bright green, about 2 minutes. Drain the broccoli and rinse under cold water until the broccoli is cool enough to handle. Drain and set aside.\n3. Stir the remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 3 tablespoons cold water together in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.\n4. Heat a wok over high heat until you see the first few wisps of smoke, about 3 minutes. Remove the wok from the heat and add the remaining 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and swirl to coat the wok. Return to high heat and add the marinated chicken. Spread it out evenly so every chicken piece has contact with the wok. Let sit until it starts to brown, about 2 minutes. Toss the chicken with a wok turner or spatula and cook until just slightly pink, about 2 minutes.\n5. Add the grated garlic and ginger to the wok and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the broccoli and stir-fry 30 seconds. Add the chicken broth, bouillon powder and sugar and bring to a boil. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.\n6. Slowly drizzle the cornstarch slurry into the wok and continue to cook until the sauce thickens and coats the broccoli. Pour the mixture over hot steamed rice and serve immediately.",

Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.\nFor the herb-ricotta dumplings: Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Put the ricotta in a medium bowl, add the flour, basil, chives, egg, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and gently combine until it just forms a sticky dough. Generously flour a work surface with semolina flour. Place the dough on the semolina and sprinkle the top with a light dusting of more semolina. Press out the dough into a rectangle about 8 inches by 6 inches and 1/2 inch thick. Cut into 1-inch squares.\nTransfer the dumplings to the boiling water with a slotted spoon and cook until tender and floating, about 5 minutes. Transfer the dumplings with the same spoon to the sauce; let sit for 2 minutes (resting will help the dumplings keep their shape). Gently toss with the sauce.

      "instructions": "For the crust: Heat your oven to 350 degrees F and set out a 9-inch pie plate or 10-inch removable bottom tart pan. If using a tart pan, place on a baking sheet to avoid any butter leaks. Stir together the digestive biscuit or graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, salt and cinnamon in a bowl. Add in the butter and toss well to evenly combine. Transfer the crumb mixture to the pie plate or tart pan and, using the bottom of a measuring cup or glass, evenly press the crust along the bottom and up the sides. Bake the crust for 15 minutes, then set aside to cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, prepare the filling.\nFor the filling: Melt the butter and brown sugar together in a medium saucepan over medium to medium-low heat. Once melted, add in the sweetened condensed milk and bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown and the mixture starts to pull away from the sides of the pan, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the salt and 1 teaspoon of the vanilla. Set aside to cool slightly. When cooled slightly, transfer the toffee mixture into the crust and spread into an even layer. Scatter with the toffee bits and top with the sliced banana. Cover with plastic and transfer to the fridge for at least 2 hours to chill and firm up. When chilled, whip the cream, confectioners' sugar and remaining teaspoon of vanilla on medium speed until soft peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. By whipping the cream on medium, the bubble structure will be smaller giving the whipped cream more stability which will allow it to hold up for longer. Dollop and swirl the whipped cream on top of the bananas and garnish with the chocolate shavings. This pie can be kept in the fridge for up to 5 days. To keep the whipped cream tasting fresh, I like to store it under an upturned mixing bowl as a make-shift lid.",

Pound out the cube steaks with a meat mallet until they are 1/4 to 1/2-inches thick. Salt and pepper both sides. Mix the flour, cayenne and paprika together in a bowl. Beat the eggs in another bowl. Dredge the steaks through the flour, then egg mixture, then through the flour again.\n3. Place the steak carefully in the pan as the oil will splatter. Cook until golden brown, about 4 to 6 minutes on each side. When finished, place on a sheet tray lined with paper towels, hold in a warm oven and repeat the procedure with the other pieces of steak.\n4. When all steaks have been cooked off, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the cooking oil and lower heat. Add 3 tablespoons of the leftover flour mixture to the oil and whisk to create a paste. Cook until golden, about 1 minute. Gradually add the milk to the flour and oil mixture while whisking together. Season the gravy with salt and pepper, to taste. Let cook until thickened; about 10 minutes. Pour gravy over the steak to finish and garnish with parsley.",

While the chicken is marinating, toss the tomatoes, shallots, garlic, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl. Pour the mixture into the middle of two large sheets of foil stacked on top of each other. Place one ball of burrata on top of the tomatoes, fold the foil over all the ingredients and pinch it tightly on all sides to seal it closed. Grill until the tomatoes are starting to burst and the burrata is melted and gooey, 14 to 16 minutes.\n4. Place the chicken on the grill and cook until dark grill marks appear on the bottom, 7 to 8 minutes. Flip the chicken and continue cooking until a digital thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken registers 165 degrees, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the grill and let it rest for 5 minutes. Slice the chicken into 1/2-inch-thick pieces.\n5. While the burrata and chicken are grilling, bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
