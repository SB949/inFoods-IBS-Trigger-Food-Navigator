Cook the mushrooms:\n   - Heat a large high-sided skillet over medium heat until hot, about 3 minutes.\n   - Add the mushrooms, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup cold water.\n   - Cover and cook until the mushrooms have shrunk a bit, about 3 minutes.\n   - Uncover and cook until the liquid evaporates.\n   - Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes.\n   - Transfer to a plate; set aside.\n\n3.

Add the vegetable oil, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, oregano, paprika, lemon juice, garlic, scallion, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper to the bag and whisk to combine. Add the London broil and seal the bag tightly. Remove the bag from the pan and use your hands to rotate the meat, coating thoroughly in the marinade. Lay the bag flat on a cutting board and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour, flipping the bag after 30 minutes. (The seasoned meat can also be stored in the refrigerator overnight. Let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before cooking.)\n\nRemove the steak from the bag and discard any stuck-on garlic cloves and scallion. Set a grill pan over high heat until just starting to smoke, about 3 minutes. (Or prepare a grill for high heat.) Lightly oil the pan. Place the steak in the center of the pan and grill until the bottom is nicely charred, about 5 minutes. Flip the steak and continue grilling until an insert-read thermometer inserted sideways into the center of the steak registers between 120 and 125 degrees F, 3 to 5 minutes more. Transfer the steak to the cutting board and rest for 10 minutes.\n\nFor the vinaigrette: While the steak rests, whisk the cilantro, olive oil, cumin, lime zest and juice, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a large bowl. Pour half of the vinaigrette into a small bowl and set aside.\n\nFor the salad: Add the bell peppers and onions to the large bowl of vinaigrette and toss to thoroughly coat. Arrange the onions cut-side down and the peppers skin--side down on the same grill pan over high heat and grill until deeply charred, about 4 minutes. Transfer to the same cutting board as the steak.\n\nAdd the remaining vinaigrette back to the large bowl. Add grated cheese and salad greens and toss to combine. Arrange the salad mixture on a large serving platter. Top with the grilled peppers.\n\nCut the roots off the onion halves and slice the onions into thin wedges. Arrange on the salad. Thinly slice the rested steak against the grain and arrange in the center of the salad. Arrange the avocado slices around the edge of the platter, then sprinkle tortilla strips over the top of the salad.",

Brush both sides of the aubergine slices with 1/3 cup olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange on a baking pan and bake, turning once, until tender and golden brown on both sides, about 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F.\n\n3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and breaking up any clumps with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 6 minutes.\n\n4. Add the onion, garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until softened, about 6 minutes.\n\n5. Add the cinnamon, allspice and tomato paste and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the wine and boil until reduced by about half, about 3 minutes.\n\n6. Add the tomatoes and oregano and bring to a simmer, then simmer until slightly thickened and the flavors have blended, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\nFor the bechamel:\n1. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring, 1 minute.\n\n2. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly and stopping occasionally to run a rubber spatula around the edges of the pan to prevent burning.\n\n3. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly, then simmer 2 minutes.\n\n4. Remove from the heat and add the goat cheese and Parmesan, whisking until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Whisk in the egg yolks.\n\nTo assemble:\n1. Arrange half of the aubergine in a single layer on the bottom of an 8-inch square glass baking dish.\n\n2. Top with half of the meat sauce. Layer the remaining aubergine slices on top followed by the remaining meat sauce.\n\n3. Top with an even layer of bechamel.\n\n4. Place the baking dish on a foil-lined baking pan and bake until bubbling and the topping is golden brown in places, 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n5. Let stand at least 20 minutes, then garnish with the parsley and serve.",

Once the skillet is warm, pour the egg mixture in and allow it to cook undisturbed until the edges are set, about 1 minute. Use a spatula to gently lift the edges of the egg and allow the uncooked egg to run underneath. Once the egg is fully set, about 4 minutes, place the slices of cheese in the center of the egg. Carefully lift each side of the egg and folder it over the cheese to form a square package about the size of your toasted bread. Flip the eggs over gently, keeping the package intact, and allow the folded side to cook and melt the cheese, about 30 seconds more.\n\n3. Assemble the sandwich by layering the bacon on 1 slice of toast and then topping with the warm eggs. Top with the remaining slice of toast and serve immediately.\n\nCook's Note: You can substitute just about any cheese for the Cheddar called for in this recipe. Some cheeses that melt well include American, provolone, Monterey Jack, pepper jack and Swiss. Crispy pancetta can be substituted for bacon. To make crispy pancetta, place slices of pancetta on a foil-lined sheet pan and put the pan into a cold oven. Set the oven for 375 degrees F and cook until the pancetta is crisp, about 10 minutes. Place the pancetta on a plate lined with a paper towel to drain.",

        "One 2- to 3-pound chicken fryer, cut up",
        "2 carrots, diced",
        "2 celery stalks, diced",
        "1/2 medium onion, diced",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
        "1/2 teaspoon ground thyme",
        "1/4 teaspoon turmeric",
        "16 ounces frozen home-style egg noodles (such as Reames)",
        "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
        "Splash of half-and-half, optional",
        "2 teaspoons finely minced fresh parsley"

      "instructions": "1. Start by putting the chicken in a pot and covering it with water. Bring the water to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 45 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot. Set the chicken aside to cool briefly.\n2. Shred the chicken with 2 forks, reserving the bones. Return the bones to the pot and boil for 20 minutes. Remove the bones from the pot and discard.\n3. Add the shredded chicken, carrots, celery and onions to the pot. Then add the salt, pepper, thyme and turmeric. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the noodles; no need to thaw them first!\n4. Finally, mix the flour with 1/2 cup water until smooth. Stir the flour mixture, the splash of half and half (if you're into that kind of thing) and the minced parsley into the pot. Simmer until the noodles are tender, about 15 minutes, tasting and adding more salt if needed at the end. The soup should be thick and stew-like and your kitchen should smell like home.",
